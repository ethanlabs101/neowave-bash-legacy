This is the original Bash version of NeoWave, my custom system info and terminal tool built around Neofetch. Consider this a legacy repo — it shows my early work and the foundation for the more advanced Lua version.

⚠️ Legacy Notice: Some features like custom ASCII logos and full color overrides don’t fully work in this version. For the latest and fully featured NeoWave, see the Lua version.

## 💻 Overview

NeoWave Bash was my first attempt at building a configurable, modular system info tool. It allowed:
 - Custom ASCII logos (limited in Bash)
 - Color presets for text and info modules
 - Right-aligned info modules
 - Preview, apply, and revert configs

It’s a lightweight approach to customizing Neofetch, designed to experiment with terminal aesthetics, info overrides, and system manipulation.

⚙️ How It Works
-  Run neowave from your terminal.
-  Use the CLI menu to:
-  Preview and apply new configurations.
-  Toggle ASCII logos (distro or custom).
-  Change color presets (red, green, blue, yellow, purple).
-  All changes generate a temporary config (tmp.conf) which can be previewed or applied.
-  Original NEOFETCH configs are backed up in stock_configs so you can revert safely.

## 🚧 What Works
 - Right-aligned info modules
 - Config preview, apply, and revert system
 - Basic color customization from presets
 - Experimentation with distro ASCII logos

---

 ##  ⚠️ Limitations
 - Custom ASCII logos are broken or limited
 - Terminal background and full color override not implemented
 - No “fast fetch” mode support
 - Limited compatibility with modern terminal emulators (some features may not render correctly)

---

## 🏗️ The Ceiling Hit

This Bash version represents my early system experimentation. I pushed the boundaries of config-driven Neofetch manipulation, but Bash inherently limits:
 - Modular flexibility
 - Advanced ASCII/graphics handling
 - Full color and terminal modifications

This is why the Lua version was developed — to unlock full customization, module overrides, and proper ASCII/color support.

---

## 💡 Notes
 - This version is meant as a learning and proof-of-concept tool.
 - Lua version is recommended for full customization and modern terminal support.
 - Use responsibly; intended for personal research and terminal enhancement.
