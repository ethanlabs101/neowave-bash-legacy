## NeoWave Bash (Legacy) 🖤

This is the original Bash version of NeoWave, my custom system info and terminal tool built around Neofetch. Consider this a legacy repo — it shows my early work and the foundation for the more advanced Lua version.

⚠️ Legacy Notice: Some features like custom ASCII logos and full color overrides don’t fully work in this version. For the latest and fully featured NeoWave, see the Lua version.

## 💻 Overview

NeoWave Bash was my first attempt at building a configurable, modular system info tool. It allowed:
 • Custom ASCII logos (limited in Bash)
 • Color presets for text and info modules
 • Right-aligned info modules
 • Preview, apply, and revert configs

It’s a lightweight approach to customizing Neofetch, designed to experiment with terminal aesthetics, info overrides, and system manipulation.
